## Product Positioning
This product is mainly aimed at students and aims to create a competitive shooting game that supports online multi-player gameplay.The development is divided into two phases:
- Initial stage: focus on core function implementation
  - Single player game
  - Record the top three highest scores in history
  - Basic gameplay
- Long-term plan: increase gameplay, design more modes, open online competitive gameplay, design more enemies and player-controlled characters, and improve player playability.

## Target users and development process
- Target Market: Student Group
- SW development process: Agile process
- Reason to choose Agile:
  - Adapting to rapidly changing market demandsï¼šChanging market trendsï¼ŒAgile development can quickly adjust game content and functions through short-cycle iterations, keep up with market changes, and seize opportunities.
  - Improve development efficiency and shorten time to market: Agile development emphasizes the rapid construction of game prototypes, obtaining player feedback through early testing, promptly identifying problems and making improvements, and avoiding large-scale rework later.
  - Improve game quality and player satisfaction: In each iteration, we focus on improving and optimizing specific features to ensure higher overall quality of the game.
  - Encourage innovation and adaption to new technologies: Mini games need to keep innovating to attract players. Agile development encourages teams to try new ideas and gameplay, and quickly verify and launch new features.
  - Enhance team collaboration and communication: Mini game development requires close collaboration among different roles such as planning, programming, and art. Agile development encourages communication and collaboration among team members to improve work efficiency.Team members can promptly understand project progress and issues, thus enhancing team cohesion and execution.
- Therefore, based on these characteristics, Agile is more suitable.

### Algorithm explanations
- Dynamic enemy spawning system:
  - Weight distribution based on probability (C-level enemy aircraft 1/10, B-level 3/10, A-level 6/10)
  - The score affects the spawn probability linearly (every 1000 points increases the probability by 10%)
- Ballistic calculation system
  - Use the inverse tangent function to calculate the relative angle between the player and the enemy
  - Support angle offset to achieve fan-shaped barrage (-15Â°, 0Â°, +15Â°)
- Collision Detection System
  - Use PyGame's built-in Rect.colliderect() method
  - Object pool to manage bullet instances (avoid frequent creation/destruction of objects)
